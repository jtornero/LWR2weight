LWR2weight is a tool for computing the weight of a length frequency distribution of fishes from the length-weight relationship (LWR) of its species. This is a common calculation in fisheries science but the main purpose of LWR2weight is to help in fishing surveys when the sample weight of a length frequency distribution is missing (lost, unrcorded or unreliable due to mistakes while recording the data)

LWR2weight stores the LWR data (species, geographical area, length range and n,a,b and r parameters for a given LWR) in a sqlite file, making possible to add more LWR's not only for other species but for different geographical areas of the same species.
